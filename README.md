Here you will find all the material used for the creation of the project. Below is a brief overview of the available notebooks and folders:

Notebooks:
- clustering_train(deprecated).ipynb: used as the original idea for cleaning the training data, but due to computational issues, not used in the final project.
- Clean_train.ipynb: code for cleaning the training data.
- Train_Model.ipynb / Train_Model_DA.ipynb: contains model training, both with and without data augmentation.
- Threshold_images_degraded.ipynb: used for cleaning degraded images in the test set.
- Test_Model.ipynb: evaluation of trained models.

Folders:
- PDF part: contains the original PDF and two notebooks.
  - Classification Food/NoFood.ipynb: trains the model to classify images from the PDF into "Food" and "NoFood" and saves it.
  - PDF_image_extraction.ipynb: extracts images from the PDF and classifies them into Food/NoFood.
